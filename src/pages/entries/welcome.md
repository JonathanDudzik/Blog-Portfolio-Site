I write about what I have learned as I work on personal projects related to software development and project management. I hope that you can find something useful :)

Right now, I am studying to become a [Microsoft Certified Azure Developer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-developer/) (what a mouthful of a title). So naturally, I am writing about that experience. I am also writing about the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language and the [Azure Go SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go).

> There is so much that I have come to love about Go, but most of all, is the pure simplicity of the syntax and type system. Compared to JavaScript with its large API, Go feels so *navigable* and readable!

I also have an interest in learning the Rust language, so I have a few posts here that serve as a gentle introduction to how Rust works: the syntax, type system, and basic usage.

In all my writing, I try to explain new concepts in detail. However, I find you need a refresher on the basics of web development and technologies, I suggest you do assume a basic understanding the the following concepts: 
- Basic usage of a text editor
- Basic understanding of any computer "language" (HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Basic usage of a command line (PowerShell, Bash, etc.)
- GitHub as a platform for exploring source code

The posts are listed in descending chronological order along the right hand side menu. Below the listing of posts, there is a button that will bring up the Go Playground in a new tab. The playground is useful for quickly testing out Go code in a sand-boxed environment.

**Enjoy!**
