Here is where I write about lessons learned and knowledge gained as I contribute to the open source Servo project. Servo is an experimental browser engine written in Rust that is memory safe and concurrent.

>Contributing to the Servo project is a great way to gain understanding about how browsers work internally, learn more of the Rust language, and be part of an open source community.

Since Servo is a browser written in the Rust language, the content of the first few posts serves as a gentle introduction to how Rust works: the syntax, type system, and memory management.

After a Basic foundation of Rust knowledge is established, I look at the process and challenges of installing the experimental browser engine on Windows Subsystem for Linux, running the engine, and then hacking it.

Although I try to explain new concepts in detail, I do assume a basic understanding the the following concepts: 
- Function declarations and calls 
- The difference between parameters and arguments
- The purpose of language libraries
- Loops and iteration
- Mutability
- Boolean, String, and Number types
- Basic math (pre-algebra)

If you feel you need a refresher on any of those topics, check out Freecodecamp.com for the programming items and [OpenStax]() for the math items.

> This is not a blog of random thoughts and musings. Instead, I want to take a more-or-less structured approach. 

The posts are listed in descending chronological order along the right hand side menu. Below the listing of posts, there is a button that will bring up the Rust Playground in a new tab. The playground is useful for quickly testing out Rust code in a sandboxed environment. 

**Enjoy!**
