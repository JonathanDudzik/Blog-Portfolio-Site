Here is where I write about lessons learned and knowledge gained as I contribute to the open source [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) project. Playwright is a Node.js library written in typescript to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. It is commonly used as a headless browser for cross-browser automation tasks including automated testing.

>With Playwright, you can better understand how browsers work internally, implement automated E2E testing, and be part of an open source community!

I also have an interest in learning the Rust language, so I have a few posts here that serve as a gentle introduction to how Rust works: the syntax, type system, and basic usage.

In all my writing, I try to explain new concepts in detail. However, I do assume a basic understanding the the following concepts: 
- Function declarations and calls 
- The difference between parameters and arguments
- The purpose of language libraries
- Loops and iteration
- Mutability
- Boolean, String, and Number types
- Basic math (pre-algebra)

If you feel you need a refresher on any of those topics, check out Freecodecamp.com for the programming items and [OpenStax]() for the math items.

> This is not a blog of random thoughts and musings. Instead, I want to take a more-or-less structured approach. 

The posts are listed in descending chronological order along the right hand side menu. Below the listing of posts, there is a button that will bring up the Rust Playground in a new tab. The playground is useful for quickly testing out Rust code in a sand-boxed environment. 

**Enjoy!**
